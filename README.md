### Small Description
This project implements the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm for procedural content generation. It focuses on generating patterns and structures based on input tiles and constraints. The algorithm works by observing and propagating possibilities to create coherent outputs. Users can supply custom tile sets to produce unique results. The project includes tools for preparing tiles and defining adjacency rules. It also provides example outputs to demonstrate how the algorithm works. This repository is ideal for experimenting with procedural generation in games, textures, or maps. The code is modular and easy to extend for both 2D and 3D applications.
